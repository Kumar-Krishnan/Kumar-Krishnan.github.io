                        <h4>Snapshot</h4>
                        This app is currently under-developement, this is a beta example with a much simpler data model than the final product. Snapshot is designed to store snapshots of a user's psychological profile. It utilizes self-assessment measures of depression, anxiety, and other psychological dimensions to give users the ability to track their moods over time and utilizes graphs to illustrate this data. 
                    </div>

                    <div class="technologiesUsedAndLessonsLearned">
                        Snapshot utilizes an SQL database and rails in the backend and React.js in the front end. Jbuilder was utilized to organize json data in the backend, and Plot.ly was utilized to display the data as graphs. Finally semantic-ui-react was utilized for styling purposes.

                            <p>A simple app built to allow users to browse through famous quotes, stores their favorite ones, and super-like upto ten of them that describe the current trajectory of the user's path, whether that user be an individual or an organization.</p>

                    <div class="technologiesUsedAndLessonsLearned">
                        <p>Velocity was built using a MERN stack. This app utilizes an api call with header injections, and a simple internal api call to retieve quotes. The focus of this project was to build a mobile friendly app utilizing React and familiarizing myself with both React and making API calls.</p>

                            <p>Task Force is an app that allows community members to log issues facing the community, such as domestic violence, or substance use in an area, then other community members would be able to create "task forces" to address those specific issue in a very focused way and recruit other members to their team. Currently users are able to create cities, issues, taskforces, and upload their volunteer info into taskforces. The end goal would be to also introduce integration with slack to allow for fast communication and mobilization.</p>

                    <div class="technologiesUsedAndLessonsLearned">
                        <p>Connect four was great practice in utilizing jquery, html, css, javascript, and in starting to think programmatically. The project utilized a two dimensional array model in javascript to represent the gameboard.</p>
